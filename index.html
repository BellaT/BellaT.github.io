								<h2>About</h2>
								<p>After having spent the past 5 years honing my skills as a self-employed DJ and working freelance for an interior designer, I wanted to look further into the future and find something that I was passionate about and that would utilise the more technical side of my skill set. I stumbled into coding and it instantly struck a chord. After spending some time researching it and teaching myself code online, I decided to throw myself into the deep end and enrol with General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive (WDI) course.  Combining my past experience in the creative industries and a new foundation in web development I am looking forward to heading into the industry to learn more as a developer.</p>

								<h2>ZNN</h2>
								<p>ZNN was a group project where we were given the task of making a Node app using an API, and we thought what better use of an API than to create a app explaining how to survive a zombie apocalypse. Google Maps and Google Places were the main APIs and we even included a heatmap to show the zombie infestation. ZNN was built with JavaScript, jQuery, Express, Node, Mongoose.</p>

								<h2>Pitch</h2>
								<p>A festival finding app. Building on my love of music and festivals, I made an app where a user can search by either country, genre, month or festival to find one they would like to know more about or purchase tickets for. With this project I was able to spend more time on the front-end and experiment with styling tools, such as Parallax.js and Foundation. This app was built using Ruby on Rails, Bcrypt, Ransack, Carrierwave.</p>

								<h2>Mastermind</h2>
								<p>For our first assignment at GA we were asked to build a vanilla JavaScript game, and I chose to make a version of Mastermind. Here the player has to try and beat the computer by guessing a collection of colours and it's order with only 10 attempts. Although this is a simpler app built with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML & CSS...this game is very addictive.</p>
